# 🖼️ Single Image Super-Resolution using Deep Learning  
**Final Project – Deep Learning and its Applications to Signal and Image Processing and Analysis**  
Course Number: 361.2.1120

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on solving the **Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)** problem: generating high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs using deep neural networks. Two models are compared:
- **Baseline**: SRResNet – a well-known architecture based on residual learning.
- **Custom Model**: An enhanced EDSR-inspired architecture we designed, featuring deeper residual blocks, no BatchNorm, adaptive learning rate, and improved normalization.

We evaluated performance using **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and **FID**, and included an **ablation study** replacing L1 loss with MSE to assess the effect of the loss function.
